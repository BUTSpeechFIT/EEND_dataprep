# End-to-End Neural Diarization data preparation

Recipe for generating training data for diarization by Brno University of Technology. \
The recipe uses telephone recordings from Switchboard and NIST SRE evaluations to generate the conversations. This follows the [data setup proposed by Hitachi](https://github.com/hitachi-speech/EEND/blob/b851eecd8d7a966487ed3e4ff934a1581a73cc9e/egs/callhome/v1/run_prepare_shared_eda.sh). Our recipe optionally adds reverberation and/or background noises.

For more details, please refer to [From Simulated Mixtures to Simulated Conversations as Training Data for End-to-End Neural Diarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00890)


## Usage
In `config_variables.sh` set the variables:
`KALDIDIR` with the path where you have Kaldi.
`WORKDIR` with the directory where you want to generate the recordings (bear in mind that the default 2480 hours can be more than 0.5TB).
`RTTMS_FILE` with the file that contains reference RTTMs from which to extract statistics about turns, pauses and overlaps. For example, those of recordings of DIHARD 3 development CTS.
`HITACHI_EEND_DIR` with the directory where you have https://github.com/hitachi-speech/EEND Note that you will need to run the stage 0 of https://github.com/hitachi-speech/EEND/blob/master/egs/callhome/v1/run_prepare_shared_eda.sh to generate the Kaldi-style data paths and VAD labels for Switchboard and SRE sets.

To run the data-generation recipe, execute `generate_data.sh`. It will calculate statistics from the RTTMs, define train and validation sets of speakers, define the conversations and generate their corresponding Kaldi-style data directories. Then, given the choice of augmentations (reverb and noises), it will generate the waveforms and produce their data directories.
