The checkpoints correspond to a model trained with a set of 2480 hours where only background noises were used as data augmentation.
This model was used to produce the "SC VoxPopuli" results before fine-tuning in "MULTI-SPEAKER AND WIDE-BAND SIMULATED CONVERSATIONS AS TRAINING DATA FOR END-TO-END NEURAL DIARIZATION"
